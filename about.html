  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    Hello. My name is Jais which is short for Jasvir Singh Cheema. I'm an Indian born software
    developer living in Melbourne for last 10 years. I have experience in various technologies
    ranging from Ruby on Rails on the backend, React and Elm on the frontend to Swift, React
    Native and Objective-c for the mobile applications. Outside of the software game, I love playing
    cricket and dabble a little bit in classical singing.

    I currently work for <a http="http://trikeapps.com">TrikeApps</a>, leading a small team of developers
    building amazing content for <a href="https://radiopaedia.org">Radiopaedia</a>.
