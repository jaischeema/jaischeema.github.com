Holy Shit..!! Amazing contest of cricket..Before this match It had been about 3 years since I watched a full match and what a good one to end the streak. It all started with a nervous and twitchy start from Sehwag and Sachinâ€™s cool on the other end. After Sehwag, Gambhir came in and gave Sachin ample time to settle down and get to his fifth hundred in world cups, the most by a player which is closely followed by Ricky Pointing, Steve Waugh And Sourav Ganguly at 4 each, Ricky being the only one playing currently. India posted a very good total of 338 runs even though they lost too many wickets in the last 10 overs.

AND Then it was all followed by Strauss with an amazing knock and another display of helpless Indian bowling. But thank god, we have Zaks and made a comeback into the game and it finally ended in a Tie. One point each, not too bad after 45 overs of bad bowling..:P So good work guys and please pay us for medical insurances if you want to keep doing that. Cheers!
