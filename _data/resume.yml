outline:
  I am proactively improving my skills, trying new things and have a general
  eagerness to learn.  Most of my current skills started off in personal
  projects and have been predominately self-taught. I love experimenting with
  new things and figuring out what I can bring back from these experiments into
  my regular projects. I appreciate a hands on approach to gain knowledge and
  have a range of experiences from core business applications such as online
  stores and logistics backends to iOS apps and games. I consider myself
  a people person and love to work with others to achieve the best solution to
  the problem at hand. I always look to learn from co-workers and gather
  feedback to improve
  my own processes.
