Every developer has their own tools configured in a way they like. The care and
time you put into configuring your tools pays for itself in increased
productivity and you feeling good everytime you use something nifty you added to
your setup.

## Editor

I use vim, [neovim]() to be specific, and have been using that for last 3 years.
Before that I tried many many other editors but never was satisified with any
of those. Even now I would try something new that will come but always come
back to vim because it is amazing.

My vimrc can be found here: 

## Computer

I use Macbook Pro as my main machine. It is the late 2016 edition, which is
already outdated. I upgraded to this machine from late 2013 model but the gains
were pretty minimal. I really liked the 13" screen size on my old machine but
decided to move to 15" to try it out and also because this was the best bang
for buck. Lot of my colleagues and friends have moved over to Linux because of
their aversion to non-standard ports on the Apple computers and also limited
choice in various components but I still don't feel that is a dealbreaker for
me. These machines take out decision fatigue, are the best computers ever
built and I just can't live without the polished versions of different
software that you can find on MacOSX.

## Shell

I use zshell with oh-my-zsh. Nothing much has been customised there but I use
my own theme, jaischeema, which has been contributed back to the main repo.
I use [iTerm]() instead of the inbuilt Terminal application because it is amazing

## Browser

I mainly use Google Chrome. I have tried Firefox, Safari and Opera but always
felt like Chrome had all the features and extensions I wanted. Additional
benefit is that I am using the same browser that most of the users of the
applications I work on are using.


## Productivity

Alfred is the most used app on my machine after the browser and the editor. If
I ever moved to Linux, this'll be the one app that I will miss the most. My
whole workflow is centered around this. The producitivy boost from this app is
just amazing.

1Password is the password manager I use and have been using for 4 years. It is
amazing software and just gets the work done. They are very proactively
developing this and add amazing features regularly. This is the only software
that I use the touchbar with and it makes filling in the password heaps faster.
I think I am actually in the danger of forgetting my master password.

Here is the list of the other software that I use on daily basis:

* [Airmail]()
* [Dash]()
* [Divvy]()
* [Dropbox]()
