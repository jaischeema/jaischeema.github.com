Hi, welcome to brand new edition of my blog. This is **yet another** attempt at trying to regularly write something semi-important
and maintaining a decent online presence. As is customery when learning new things, lets start with the
hello world initiative.

👋🏻

Few reasons why I want to blog:

  * Historical record keeping of interesting things that I have done/attempted.
  * Recording all the problems I encountered and solved, or didn't solve for my benefit and anyone else's.
  * Getting better at writing.
  * Building a habit
  * Attempting something out of comfort zone.

Bon voyage!
